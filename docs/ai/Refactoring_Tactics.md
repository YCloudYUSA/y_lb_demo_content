# Refactoring Tactics

This document outlines potential refactoring tactics that could be considered for maintaining and improving the `y_lb_demo_content` module codebase. These are general principles, and their applicability should be evaluated based on specific needs as the codebase evolves.

## 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

*   **Observation:** Classes like `YLbDemoContentMigrationSubscriber` handle multiple migration events (`PRE_IMPORT`, `POST_IMPORT`) and conditional logic based on migration IDs (`onMigratePreImport`, `onMigratePostImport`).
*   **Tactic:** If this class or similar ones grow significantly in complexity, consider splitting them into smaller, more focused classes. For example, separate event subscribers for distinct events or major migration types. This improves readability, testability, and maintainability.

## 2. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

*   **Observation:** The codebase relies heavily on declarative YAML migration files (`config/install/migrate_plus.migration.*.yml`). There are many similar files defining migrations for different demo content types (blocks, pages, media, etc.).
*   **Tactic:** While YAML is declarative, look for opportunities to reduce structural duplication.
    *   If common processing steps exist across multiple migrations, ensure they leverage shared constants (`constants:` section in migrations) or potentially custom process plugins where appropriate.
    *   For Layout Builder configurations within page migrations (`y_lb_demo_page_*.yml`), which can be verbose, be mindful of repeated patterns. While difficult to abstract in pure YAML, significant repetition might warrant a review of the generation process or considering alternative approaches if maintainability becomes an issue.

## 3. Improve Clarity and Readability

*   **Observation:** Migration files, especially page migrations with embedded Layout Builder configurations, can become very long. PHP classes use descriptive names.
*   **Tactic:**
    *   **Naming:** Continue using clear and descriptive names for migrations, classes, methods, and variables.
    *   **Comments:** Add comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious sections, especially within PHP code (e.g., custom process plugins, event subscribers).
    *   **YAML Structure:** Keep YAML files well-formatted and potentially add comments within the YAML where complex mappings or processes occur. For very long files like page migrations, ensure consistent structuring of sections (e.g., `1header`, `2banner`, `3body`) to aid navigation.

## 4. Modularity and Encapsulation

*   **Observation:** The codebase includes a submodule (`modules/y_lb_demo_content_af_promotion`), indicating an attempt at modular design. Migrations are grouped by content type (e.g., `_block_`, `_page_`, `_media_`).
*   **Tactic:**
    *   Maintain clear boundaries between the main module and any submodules. Ensure dependencies are explicit and coupling is minimized.
    *   Continue organizing migrations logically (e.g., by entity type, by feature).
    *   If custom PHP logic (plugins, subscribers) becomes tightly coupled to specific migration groups, evaluate if it can be made more generic or if it truly belongs within that specific migration's context or a dedicated service.

## 5. Configuration Management

*   **Observation:** The module heavily uses Drupal's configuration system for migrations.
*   **Tactic:** Ensure configuration files are kept clean and only contain necessary overrides or definitions. Regularly review installed configuration for potential drift or outdated entries. Use configuration splits or similar methods if environment-specific migration configurations are needed, although this seems less likely for demo content.

## 6. Dependency Management

*   **Observation:** Dependencies are declared in `composer.json` and `*.info.yml` files.
*   **Tactic:** Keep dependencies up-to-date and clearly define version constraints. Remove unused dependencies. Ensure module dependencies in `*.info.yml` accurately reflect the code's requirements.
