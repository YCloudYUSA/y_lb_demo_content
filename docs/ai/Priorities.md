# Priorities

Based on the codebase structure, dependencies, and git history, the following priorities can be inferred for the `y_lb_demo_content` module:

1.  **Core Demo Content Maintenance:** The primary function is providing demo content (`articles`, `events`, `promotions`, `tags`, `files`, `media`) and Layout Builder block instances (`block_*`) for the `y_lb` module and its associated block types (`lb_cards`, `lb_hero`, etc.). Ensuring this content is accurate, up-to-date with block features, and imports correctly via migrations is the highest priority.

2.  **Layout Builder Page Examples:** The `page_*` migrations are crucial as they demonstrate how the various demo blocks are assembled using Layout Builder sections (`lb_sections` plugin) to create realistic page structures (Homepage, Who We Are, Programs, Location, Membership, etc.). Maintaining the integrity and functionality of these demo page layouts is essential.

3.  **Dependency Alignment:** The module heavily relies on `y_lb`, `lb_cards`, `lb_hero`, `ws_promotion`, `openy_custom`, and others specified in `composer.json` and `y_lb_demo_content.info.yml`. Keeping the demo content compatible with the specified versions (or newer releases) of these dependencies is critical for installation and functionality. Git history shows updates related to dependency bumps and related feature changes (e.g., recurring events, card descriptions).

4.  **Migration System Integrity:** The use of `migrate_plus` with `embedded_data` sources and extensive `migration_lookup` processes means the migration definitions themselves are complex and vital. Ensuring the migration dependencies (`migration_dependencies`) are correct and the process plugins function as expected is key to successful content import.

5.  **Menu Integration & `menu_item_extras`:** The `YLbDemoContentMigrationSubscriber` specifically handles cleaning up menus before import and linking a demo Menu CTA block to a specific menu item post-import. This indicates a reliance on and integration with the main menu system and potentially the `menu_item_extras` module's functionality, which needs to be maintained.

6.  **Asset Management:** A significant number of image assets (`assets/images/`) are included. Past git commits show efforts focused on optimization (`imageoptim`) to reduce file size. Ensuring these assets are correctly referenced and reasonably sized remains important.

7.  **Refinement and Accuracy:** Recent commits focus on removing hardcoded "Demo" prefixes, using `[site:url]` tokens for links, and adapting to changes like "Twitter" to "X". Continual refinement of the demo content for accuracy and better representation is an ongoing, medium priority.

8.  **Submodule Functionality (`y_lb_demo_content_af_promotion`):** The existence of this submodule suggests Activity Finder + Promotions is a distinct feature set. Ensuring its migrations run correctly and integrate properly is important if this feature is actively maintained.

9.  **Code Maintainability (PHP):** The PHP code (subscriber, process plugin) is relatively small but essential. Ensuring it adheres to standards and remains functional, especially the event subscriber logic, is necessary.
