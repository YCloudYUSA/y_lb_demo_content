## Major Changes & Trends

*   **Feature Expansion:** Significant effort has gone into adding a wide variety of demo content migrations. This includes various Layout Builder blocks (Banners, Cards, Accordions, Icon Grids, Ping-Pong, Statistics, Webforms, etc.) and complete demo pages (Homepage, Location pages, Program pages, Events, Articles, Membership, Schedules, Promotions, AF4, etc.). Development seems structured, often referencing ticket IDs (e.g., DS-xxxx).
*   **Refactoring & Modernization:**
    *   There was a noticeable shift from using Paragraph-based migrations to Layout Builder Block-based migrations for components like Accordion, Cards, Carousel, Donate, Icon Grid, and Statistics (`cd4edb9`).
    *   Activity Finder (AF4) promotion-related content was moved into a dedicated submodule (`y_lb_demo_content_af_promotion`) (`31561df`).
    *   Some custom migration process plugins were removed, possibly indicating they were moved to a core module (`805d94a`).
*   **Dependency Management:** Updates to `composer.json` show additions and version bumps for dependencies like `ycloudyusa/y_lb`, `drupal/lb_cards`, `open-y-subprojects/openy_custom`, `drupal/ws_promotion`, and `drupal/lb_hero`. Compatibility requirements were updated (e.g., PHP >=8.1).
*   **Content & Link Refinement:** Several commits focus on improving the demo content itself, such as removing "Demo" prefixes (`3c58b7b`), adding `[site:url]` tokens to links (`c1c8f4b`, `8f741f9`), fixing meta descriptions (`9eeafaa`), and updating icon usage/descriptions (`a953281`).
*   **Optimization:** Efforts were made to reduce the size of demo images (`daaf61e`, `2fb727b`, `e9bf909`).
*   **Bug Fixing:** Commits indicate fixes related to QA findings and specific issues, such as sponsor section width (`41b8677`), menu CTA block linking (`4efd8b4`, `87f2d9f`), and event descriptions (`129aad2`).
