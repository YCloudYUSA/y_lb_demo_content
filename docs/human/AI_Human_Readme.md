# Documentation Structure: AI-Generated vs. Human-Reviewed

This directory structure (`docs/ai` and `docs/human`) is designed to leverage AI for generating initial documentation drafts while ensuring accuracy and clarity through human review.

## `docs/ai` Directory

*   **Purpose:** Contains documentation files automatically generated by AI tools analyzing the codebase (`y_lb_demo_content` and related modules/dependencies).
*   **Usage:** These documents serve as **first drafts** or **starting points**. They can help quickly outline the project's structure, identify components, and provide initial descriptions based purely on the code.
*   **Caution:** AI-generated content may contain inaccuracies, omissions, or interpretations that require human validation. It should **not** be considered the definitive documentation on its own.

## `docs/human` Directory

*   **Purpose:** Contains the **canonical documentation** for the project. Files in this directory have been reviewed, edited, and verified by human contributors.
*   **Usage:** This is the **source of truth** for understanding the project's features, installation, usage, and architecture. If you need reliable information about `y_lb_demo_content`, refer to the documents within this directory.
*   **Process:** Ideally, documents start in `docs/ai` and, after human review and necessary corrections/additions, are moved or copied into `docs/human`.

By using this structure, we aim to speed up the documentation process with AI assistance while maintaining high-quality, accurate, and human-approved documentation in the `docs/human` folder.
